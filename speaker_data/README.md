# Loudspeaker Explorer speaker data

This directory contains the raw speaker "spinorama" data that Loudspeaker
Explorer uses.

Currently, all data comes from speaker reviews made by [amirm][] from
[AudioScienceReview][]. If you enjoy the use of this data,
[consider donating][donate].

There is one directory per speaker measurement. The contents of each directory
are identical to the contents of the data zipfile that amirm publishes.

Contrary to Loudspeaker Explorer itself, **this data is not licensed under
MIT**. Measurements made on or after 2020-03-02 are licensed under a
[Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license][cc], as indicated by the `LICENSE.txt`
file in each directory.
