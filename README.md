This is the development home of Loudspeaker Explorer, a speaker measurement visualization, analysis and comparison tool.

You might be looking for the ready-to-use [rendered Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dechamps/LoudspeakerExplorer-rendered/blob/master/Loudspeaker_Explorer.ipynb) or the [AudioScienceReview thread](https://www.audiosciencereview.com/forum/index.php?threads/loudspeaker-explorer-analyze-visualize-compare-speaker-data.11503/).

## Developer information

**CAUTION: changes made in Colab cannot be merged back into source control because the "rendered" notebook format is very different from the source notebook. If you wish to make permanent changes, follow the below instructions instead.**

To make version control easier, in this repository the Loudspeaker Explorer Jupyter Notebook is stored as a [Jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) Markdown file. Jupytext is used to convert the Markdown file to Jupyter Notebook format (`.ipynb`) for publishing on Colab.

The best way to set up a development environment for Loudspeaker Explorer is to [install](https://jupyter.org/install.html) Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab as well as [Jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). Then simply open `Loudspeaker_Explorer.md`. Happy hacking!
