This is the development home of Loudspeaker Explorer, a speaker measurement visualization, analysis and comparison tool.

To make version control easier, in this repository the Loudspeaker Explorer Jupyter Notebook is stored as a [Jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext) Markdown file. Jupytext is used to convert the Markdown file to Jupyter Notebook format (`.ipynb`) for publishing on Colab.
